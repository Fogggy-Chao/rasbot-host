# Project: Rabot

## TODO

- [x] **Set up OpenAI API calling**
    - [x] real-time audio streaming
    - [x] system prompt writing and ensure generation consistency
    
- [x] **Set up LLM output parsing**
    - [x] real-time audio streaming parsed response
    - [x] stuctured response parsing

// Use function calling to generate motor driver signal and build connection with motor driver
    

- [x] **Use structured response to generate motor driver signal**
    - [x] motor driver signal generation
    - [x] motor driver signal sending (websocket)

- [x] **Set up motor driver & raspberry pi**
    - [x] raspberry pi setup
    - [x] motor driver hardware setup
    - [x] motor driver connect with raspberry pi
    - [x] motor driver signal reading

- [x] **Audio driven motor testing**

## Iteration
- [ ] **Add time control to motor signal**
- [ ] **Add serial signal capability**
